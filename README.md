# comet-cosmosis

Interface to allow using the COMET emulator (https://gitlab.com/aegge/comet-emu) in [CosmoSIS](https://cosmosis.readthedocs.io/).

This repository will contain the CosmoSIS modules needed to use COMET for the modelling of large-scale structure observables and their corresponding likelihood analysis. It should be cloned inside the cosmosis-standard-library folder.

To run the COMET interface module:

> cd cosmosis-standard-library
> 
> cosmosis comet-cosmosis/code_inis/params.ini
