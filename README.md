# comet-cosmosis

Interface to allow using the COMET emulator (https://gitlab.com/aegge/comet-emu) in [CosmoSIS](https://cosmosis.readthedocs.io/).
This repository will contain the CosmoSIS modules needed to use COMET for the modelling of large-scale structure observables and their corresponding likelihood analysis.
